👋 Hi, I’m @CeruleanOrange 🍊🟦

15 july 2025:
After one year and a half, I feel more confident in my skills and I will release my first public project soon. My main languages now are Python and javascript.

19 february 2024:
I am learning programming for the first time, starting first with Python 
and then I will also learn Java. I would like to create a web service first.
